# Fitness Chatbot

This is a part of the project: Fitbeat-Gamified Fitness Platform.

A fitness chatbot using the Bag of Words model can be designed to provide information and guidance related to fitness, exercise, nutrition, and overall well-being. The Bag of Words model is a simple and commonly used technique in natural language processing (NLP) for text classification and information retrieval.

By utilizing the Bag of Words model and training a machine learning model on fitness-related data, the chatbot can understand user queries related to fitness and respond with relevant information, exercise suggestions, nutrition tips, or general advice on leading a healthy lifestyle.
